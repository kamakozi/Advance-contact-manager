# Contact Manager Program

A simple contact management system written in C++ that allows you to add, remove, search, sort, and edit contact details. The program supports basic file operations to persist contacts in a text file and allows easy access to the contact information through an interactive menu.

## Features

- **Add Contacts**: Add a new contact with a name and phone number. The program automatically assigns a unique ID.
- **Remove Contacts**: Remove a contact by selecting their ID.
- **Search Contacts**: Search for contacts by ID or name.
- **Sort Contacts**: Sort contacts either by name or by ID.
- **Edit Contacts**: Update a contact's name or phone number.
- **Open Contact File**: Open the contacts file directly from the program.
- **File Persistence**: Contacts are stored in a text file (`contacts.txt`) and loaded every time the program starts.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows (with appropriate adjustments for file handling)
